# Hello_C_Programming

This is a roadmap of what I have, or will, create. If you are familiar with C programming, you can see that I'm following Beej's guide pretty closely in terms of content structure. I like this structure and presents things logically as to when you might encounter them.

I've only currently created the foundations, so you should find hello_1 and hello_2 as folders with the example code in there. Do not just look at the example code! Write the code along with me in the videos! You need to make sure you are doing that as it is generally better to write code yourself than it is to watch someone else write it.

## Hello 1

0. History and Purpose of C
1. Variables and Statements
2. Functions
